# Stock-Data-Saving
For Raspberry Pi - To collect data using YFinance and save it onto a .txt doc for usage later. All different time intervals

The idea of this code is to put on a raspberry pi and basically record the stock data of the NASDAQ and DJ onto a txt using YFinance. Although its not loads of data straight to your door, Over a year you're going to build up a decent amount of data without spending $90 a month on some sussy website. 

Would love to later upload the market data to GIT but not sure what free use says about that. Will have to see as I get collect more data.
